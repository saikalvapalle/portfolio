Prior to this, she received her Master's degree in Organisational and Social Psychology at the London School of Economics and Political Science, and her Bachelor's degree in Psychology (Honours) at the University of Waterloo. Sai is an experimental psychologist by training, and her work has been invited for presentation at several international conferences, including the Academy of Management, European Group for Organization Studies, Strategic Management Society, Babson College Entrepreneurship Research Conference, and the Positive Organizational Scholarship conference.

Her research interests are centered around cognition and communication, and she investigate micro-level dynamics in entrepreneurial resource acquisition contexts (specifically funding pitches). She is also deeply interested in uncovering the societal discourse around entrepreneurship, and its role in marginalizing entrepreneurs.
