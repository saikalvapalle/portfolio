Don’t take communications for granted: how entrepreneurs and organisations can be more effective communicators

Businesses and practitioners benefit when they are more critical about how they value the process of communication, as well as paying attention to how they communicate. New research into a ‘relational’ approach to studying communication processes by PhD candidate Sai Kalvapalle involved studying out how prioritising the joint, mutual, and co-constructed nature of communications positively influences their outcomes. She successfully defended her thesis, Breaking the Conduit: A Relational Approach to Communication in Management and Entrepreneurship on 13 October at Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University (RSM), and is now an Assistant Professor of Strategy and Entrepreneurship at the Nova School of Business and Economics.
